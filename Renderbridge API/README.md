# ExtTemplate

This is the README of the template extension.
The RenderBridge SDK is in its own directory, so it can be easily replaced when updating to a new version.

## Build Instructions:

- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

- Run `msvc2019.bat` or `msvc2022.bat` to generate and open the project in Visual Studio.
